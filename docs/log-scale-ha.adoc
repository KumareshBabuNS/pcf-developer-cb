_Estimated Time: 30 minutes_

== What you will learn

* How to access application logs
* How to scale an application
* How to access events
* How Pivotal Cloud Foundry handles failed application instances

== Exercises

=== Push the `articulate` application

. https://github.com/eitansuez/articulate/releases/download/v0.1/articulate-0.1.jar[Download^] the `articulate` application.  Copy the file to folder: `~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/articulate/` (`~` is shorthand for the home directory in Linux, Mac and Unix based operating systems).  You will need to create this directory in your home directory.
+
NOTE: If your browser warns you about downloading this file please proceed to download it.
+
https://github.com/pivotal-enablement/articulate[Source^] is not required, but you may be curious how it works as you move through the labs.

. Push the `articulate` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cd ~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/articulate/
----
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf push articulate -p ./articulate-0.1.jar -m 512M --random-route --no-start
----

=== Access `articulate` logs

. Review the documentation on http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/streaming-logs.html[application logging^].

. Tail the logs of the `articulate` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf logs articulate
----

. Open _another_ terminal window and start the `articulate` application.  Review the output from both terminal windows.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf start articulate
----

. Open a browser and view the `articulate` application.  Read about our demo application.
+

image::ha-articulate.png[Articulate]

. Observe the log output when the `articulate` web page is refreshed.  More logs are added!

. Stop tailing logs

.. Go to the terminal tailing the logs
.. Send an interrupt (kbd:[Ctrl+C])

==== Questions

* Where should your application write logs?
* What are some of the different origin codes seen in the log?
* How does this change how you access logs today?  At scale?

=== Access `articulate` events

Events for the application can also be used to compliment the logs in determining what has occurred with an application.

[source.terminal]
----
cf events articulate
----


=== Scale `articulate`

==== Scale up

. Start tailing the logs again.
+
[alternatives#tail_logs_scaleup]
mac, linux | windows
+
[#tabs-tail_logs_scaleup-1.tail_logs_scaleup]
--
[source.terminal]
----
cf logs articulate | grep "API\|CELL"
----
--
+
[#tabs-tail_logs_scaleup-2.tail_logs_scaleup]
--
[source.terminal]
----
cf logs articulate | findstr "API CELL"
----
--

+
The above statement filters only matching log lines from the https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/architecture/cloud-controller.html[Cloud Controller^] and https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/concepts/architecture/#diego-cell[Cell^] components.

. In _another_ terminal window scale `articulate`.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -m 1G
----

. Observe log output.

. Stop tailing the logs.

. Scale `articulate` back to our original settings.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -m 512M
----

==== Scale out

. Browse to the `Scale and HA` page of the `articulate` application.
+
[.thumb]
image::scale_ha.png[Scale and HA]
+
Review the `Application Environment Information`.

. Press the `Refresh` button multiple times.  All requests are going to one application instance.

. Start tailing the logs.
+
[alternatives#tail_logs_scaleout]
mac, linux | windows
+
[#tabs-tail_logs_scaleout-1.tail_logs_scaleout]
--
[source.terminal]
----
cf logs articulate | grep 'API\|CELL'
----
--
+
[#tabs-tail_logs_scaleout-2.tail_logs_scaleout]
--
[source.terminal]
----
cf logs articulate | findstr "API CELL"
----
--

. In another terminal window, scale the `articulate` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 3
----

. Observe log output.  Then stop tailing the logs.

. Return to `articulate` in a web browser.  Press the `Refresh` button several times. Observe the `Addresses` and `Instance Index` changing.

_Notice how quickly the new application instances are provisioned and subsequently load balanced!_

==== Questions

* What is the difference between scaling out versus scaling up?

=== High Availability

Pivotal Cloud Foundry has https://blog.pivotal.io/pivotal-cloud-foundry/products/the-four-levels-of-ha-in-pivotal-cf[4 levels of HA^] (High Availability) that keep your applications and the underlying platform running.  In this section, we will demonstrate one of them.  Failed application instances will be recovered.

. At this time you should be running multiple instances of `articulate`.  Confirm this with the following command:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf app articulate
----

. Return to `articulate` in a web browser (`Scale and HA` page).  Press the `Refresh` button. Confirm the application is running.

. Kill the app.  Press the `Kill` button!

. Check the state of the app through the `cf` CLI.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf app articulate
----
+
Sample output below (notice the `requested state` vs actual `state`).  In this case, Pivotal Cloud Foundry had already detected the failure and is starting a new instance.
+

instances: 3/3

+
Repeat this command as necessary until `state` = `running`.

. In your browser, `Refresh` the `articulate` application.
+
The app is back up!
+
A new, healthy app instance has been automatically provisioned to replace the failing one.

. View which instance was killed.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf events articulate
----

. Scale `articulate` back to our original settings.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 1
----

==== Questions

* How do you recover failing application instances today?
* What effect does this have on your application design?
* How could you determine if your application has been crashing?

== Beyond the class

* Try the same exercises, but using Apps Manager instead
