== Preface

Up until now, we've focused on the deployment of applications.  But as we know, applications often use backing services: databases, message brokers, and other applications' services (to name a few).

In this lab, you'll have the opportunity to experiment with both managed services and user-provided services:  you'll create a mysql backing service to persist information about attendees, and you'll create a user-provided service to allow one application to consume the services of another without hard-coding its route.

In the process, you'll learn new cf commands:  `create-service`, `create-user-provided-service`, and `bind-service`.  Don't forget:  `cf help` is there to help us understand how to invoke each command.


== Exercises

=== Review `articulate` dependencies

`articulate` exposes functionality to add attendees on the _Services_ page.  However, `articulate` doesn't do this alone.  It makes REST calls to the `attendee-service` application. To learn more about services, let's provision the `attendee-service` application.

=== Push the `attendee-service` application

. https://github.com/eitansuez/attendee-service/releases/download/v0.1/attendee-service-0.1.jar[Download^] the `attendee-service` application.  Copy the file to folder: `~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/attendee-service/` (`~` is shorthand for the home directory in Linux, Mac and Unix based operating systems).  You will need to create this directory in your home directory.
+
NOTE: If your browser warns you about downloading this file please proceed to download it.
+
https://github.com/pivotal-enablement/attendee-service[Source^] is not required, but you may be curious how it works as you move through the labs.

. Push the `attendee-service` application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cd ~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/attendee-service/
----
+
..and:
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf push attendee-service -p ./attendee-service-0.1.jar -m 512M --random-route
----
+
Does `attendee-service` start up correctly?  Why not?

=== Add a Managed Service

. Review the http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/managing-services.html[documentation^] on managing service instances
. Review what services are available in the marketplace.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf marketplace
----

. There exist two distinct Cloud Foundry managed services that provision MySQL databases:

.. http://docs.pivotal.io/p-mysql/[p-mysql^] is a Pivotal product, and
.. http://docs.run.pivotal.io/marketplace/services/cleardb.html[cleardb^] is a company that specializes in cloud-based MySQL instances

+
[#tabs-create_service-1.create_service]
--
If working in a Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment that is not PWS, you are likely to have the _p-mysql_ managed service.

[source.terminal]
----
cf create-service p-mysql 100mb-dev attendee-mysql
----
--
+
[#tabs-create_service-2.create_service]
--
Pivotal Web Services offers the _cleardb_ managed service in its marketplace.

[source.terminal]
----
cf create-service cleardb spark attendee-mysql
----
--

. Now we need to bind the application with the service instance.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service attendee-service attendee-mysql
----
+
NOTE: You can ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage attendee-service' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message at this time.

. Restart the application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf restart attendee-service
----

. View the `attendee-service` in a browser.
+
You should see response similar to the following (pic is using the https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en[JSON Formatter for Chrome^]):

.How does this work?
****
. Read about how twelve-factor apps handle http://12factor.net/backing-services[backing services^] and http://12factor.net/config[configuration^]>.
. Read about https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/deploy-apps/environment-variable.html#VCAP-SERVICES[VCAP_SERVICES^].
. View the environment for `attendee-service`.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf env attendee-service
----
. Different languages/frameworks will have various ways to read environment variables.  `attendee-service` takes advantage of a https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack[Java Buildpack^] feature called https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack-auto-reconfiguration[Auto-Reconfiguration^] that will automatically re-write bean definitions to connect with services bound to an application.

==== Questions

* After binding a service to an application why is the application restarted/restaged?
* In this case, why could we `restart` vs `restage`?


=== Add a User-Provided Service Instance

In the enterprise, not all services will be provisioned by Pivotal Cloud Foundry.

For example, consider your Oracle RAC cluster.  How can we connect our applications running on Pivotal Cloud Foundry to these external systems?

Additionally, how can we easily connect applications together running on the platform?

`articulate's` default configuration for the `attendee-service` `uri` is `http://localhost:8181/attendees`.  The subsequent steps will allow you to override the default configuration with your own.

. Read about http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/devguide/services/user-provided.html[user-provided service instances^].

. Create a user-provided service instance.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf create-user-provided-service attendee-service -p uri
----
+
This will create an interactive prompt.  For the value of `uri`, enter your `attendee-service` application's `attendees` endpoint:
+
[source.terminal]
----
uri> {{attendees_endpoint_uri}}
----
+
CAUTION: Make sure to specify `http` (this will not work with `https`).

. Bind `articulate` to the `attendee-service` user-provided service.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service articulate attendee-service
----
+
NOTE: You can ignore the _TIP: Use 'cf restage articulate' to ensure your env variable changes take effect_ message at this time.

. Restart the application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf restart articulate
----

. Refresh the `articulate` _Services_ page.  You can now see the `attendee-service` listed under `Services`.
+

. Review the environment.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf env articulate
----

. Add some attendees.
+
NOTE: If you can't add attendees, review the `articulate` logs and the user-provided service instance configuration.

==== Questions

* From an application perspective, are managed services instances different from user-provided service instances?

== Beyond the class

* Use https://github.com/cloudfoundry-samples/spring-music[Spring Music^] and a User Provided Service Instance to connect to a database (MySQL or Oracle) in your environment.
