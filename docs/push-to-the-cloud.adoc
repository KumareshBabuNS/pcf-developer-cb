== Requirements

See link:requirements{outfilesuffix}[Lab Requirements].

== What you will learn

* How to access Apps Manager
* How to install the `cf` CLI
* How to target a Pivotal Cloud Foundry instance with the `cf` CLI
* How to `cf push` apps

== Exercises

=== Download the `cf` CLI

Endpoint and credential information for accessing Apps Manager will be provided by your instructor.  Apps Manager is a web application that helps you manage your applications, but it is also the place to download the `cf` CLI.  The next set of steps walk you through just that.

NOTE: If you are consuming these materials via e-learning and using http://run.pivotal.io/[Pivotal Web Services^] you can login to Apps Manager http://run.pivotal.io/[here^]. If you are using a Pivotal Cloud Foundry instance please see your system administrators for access to Apps Manager.

. http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/console/dev-console.html[Review the Apps Manager Documentation^].  Knowing where to go for help is essential.

. Login into Pivotal Cloud Foundry with the Apps Manager.
+
NOTE: It is common to use self signed certs in educational environments, but doing so will result in warnings from your browser.  These warnings can safely be ignored (proceed through them).

. Upon logging into Apps Manager for the first time you will be greeted with a welcome message that will walk you through the installation of the `cf` CLI.

+
If you do not see this dialog, the same information can be found under `Tools` (Left side).

. Download and http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html[install^] the `cf` CLI for your platform.

. Open a terminal window.  Explore the `cf` CLI. In the terminal window type `cf`.
+
----
$ cf
----

. Review the commands available with the `cf` CLI.  Help on a specific command can be found using the `--help` option (e.g. `cf login --help`).
+
----
$ cf login --help
----


=== Login to Pivotal Cloud Foundry with the `cf` CLI

. Continue to follow directions for logging in with the `cf` CLI.  You can copy and paste the `cf login` command directly from Apps Manager.
+
----
$ cf login -a {{api_endpoint}}
----
+
NOTE: Are SSL errors preventing you from logging in?  Try adding the `--skip-ssl-validation` option.

. Review your current API endpoint, user, org, and space
+
----
$ cf target
----

.What Just Happened?
****
You have logged into Pivotal Cloud Foundry from two different clients (Apps Manager and the `cf` CLI).  You have installed the `cf` CLI and targeted a Pivotal Cloud Foundry instance.  You are ready to `push` apps.
****

=== Pushing apps

Next we will push (deploy) several applications.

. Download the link:artifacts/demo-apps.zip[demo applications].  Copy the file to folder: `~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop` (`~` is shorthand for the home directory in Linux, Mac and Unix based operating systems).  You will need to create this directory in your https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_directory[home^] directory.

. Extract the zip file to `~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/demo-apps`.
+
The zip file contains four directories; each directory contains an application developed in a different language.

. Open a terminal window and push the `node` application
+
----
$ cd ~/pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/demo-apps/node
$ cf push node --random-route -m 128M
----

. View the `node` application in your browser or use `curl`.  The url can be obtained from the `cf push` output or by issuing the command `cf apps`.
+
.Example:
----
$ curl node-northeasterly-zygoma.cfapps.io
Hello Node
----

. Repeat steps 3 - 4 for the `php`, `python`, and `ruby` applications.
+
NOTE: Make sure you `cd` into each directory before pushing.

.What Just Happened?
****
You just deployed four applications each based on a different language and runtime.  Pivotal Cloud Foundry is a polyglot platform, meaning it supports multiple languages and does so in a pluggable way (via buildpacks)!
****

==== Questions

* What are some common items in the output that occurred when pushing each application?

=== Explore Apps Manager

. Review the following views:

* Org
* Space
* App

.What Just Happened?
****
You have interfaced with Pivotal Cloud Foudry from two separate clients (`cf` and Apps Manager).  Many of the operations that are available in `cf` CLI are also available in Apps Manager.
****

=== Clean up

. Delete the applications you just pushed.
+
This is very important for resource constrained environments.
+
----
$ cf delete node
----
+
Repeat for `php`, `python`, and `ruby` applications.
