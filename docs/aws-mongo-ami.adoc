:yourname: {{yourname}}

A MongoDB VM (Ubuntu 14.04) is available to complete the service broker lab.  The VM 
is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

== Requirements

Network connectivity and access to reach the Mongo VM (uses port `27017`) from your
Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment.  PWS woks fine.


== Installed Software

The software listed below has been installed and configured on the VM:

* MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/community/licensing[License^]


== Provisioning

You can use the following link:artifacts/mongo.tf[terraform script^].

Alternatively, you can provision the VM manually by following these directions:

. User must have access to an AWS account (can run from any account)

. User must have an existing key pair in the account or create one

. Bitnami publishes AWS AMIs for MongoDB. 
  Visit the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/[AWS Marketplace^] and
  search for "mongodb" and "bitnami".

. You should land on this page:
  https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B01M1EBY7B?qid=1494291808884&sr=0-2&ref_=srh_res_product_image[^].
  Note the AMI id: `ami-ee2694f8`
+
In the left navbar of the EC2 dashboard, under `Images`,  select `AMIs`. Then, to the
left of the search bar, change `Owned by Me` to `Public images`. Search for the above
AMI ID. Click Launch.

=== Provisioning Wizard

When launching, accept defaults except where specified.

==== Choose an Instance Type

* Use `t2.large` (8 GB memory).

**E-learning Students**: *Please note that, though this instance type is not
free-tier eligible, it is necessary for completing the service broker lab and
the PCF Developer course.* **Costs associated with its use are negligible.**
*Charges cease as soon as the instance is deprovisioned (the steps for
deprovisioning are at the end of the lab).*

==== Configure Instance Details

Auto-assign Public IP  = `Enable`

==== Add Storage

Accept defaults

==== Tag Instance

Create the following: Key = `Name`; Value = `{yourname}-mongodb-service-broker`

==== Create a Security Group

Create a security group with the following rules:

.Rule 1
....
Type = `ssh`
Protocol = `TCP`
Port Range = `22`
Source = `anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
....

.Rule 2
....
Type = `Custom TCP Rule`
Protocol = `TCP`
Port Range = `27017`
Source = `anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
....


==== Review Instance Launch

Select your key-pair and launch the instance.

Once the instance is running, select it in list of EC2 instances.
***Obtain the public IP for use in the lab***.

IMPORTANT: Once your VM is running, in the EC2 console, right-click "Instance Settings"
-> "Get System Log", and then look for the "application password" from the logs.
You'll need this password to authenticate to mongodb


== Accessing Your Mongo VM Remotely

SSH using your private key, the `bitnami` user and the public IP address of your VM.

For example:

[source.terminal]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem bitnami@53.91.185.0
----

http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html[Amazon Reference Documentation^]


== Managing MongoDB

=== Start MongoDB

[source.terminal]
----
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh start
----

=== Stop MongoDB

[source.terminal]
----
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh stop
----

=== Restart MongoDB

[source.terminal]
----
sudo /opt/bitnami/ctlscript.sh restart
----

See https://docs.bitnami.com/aws/infrastructure/mongodb/[here^] for more information.

== The Mongo Shell

The `mongo` shell is also loaded on the VM.  It can be accessed in the terminal by
doing the following:

[source.terminal]
----
mongo
----

Once in the shell, you'll have to authenticate.  The username is `root`, and the
password is the one you previously obtain from the VM system log:

[source,bash]
----
use admin
db.auth('root', '<password>')
----
