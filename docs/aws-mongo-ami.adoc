:yourname: {{yourname}}

A MongoDB VM (Ubuntu 14.04) is available to complete the service broker lab.  The VM is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

== Requirements

Network connectivity and access to reach the Mongo VM (uses port `27017`) from your Pivotal Cloud Foundry environment


== Installed Software

The software listed below has been installed and configured on the VM:

* MongoDB - https://www.mongodb.com/community/licensing[License^]


== Provisioning

You can use the following link:artifacts/mongo.tf[terraform script^].

Alternatively, you can provision the VM manually by following these directions:

. User must have access to an AWS account (can run from any account)

. User must have an existing key pair in the account or create one

. The AMI can be found be searching for `mongodb-service-broker-lab` in the EC2 Dashboard.  Must be in the N. Virginia region. Make sure you search under `Public Images`

In the left navbar of the EC2 dashboard, under `Images`,  select `AMIs`. Then, to the left of the search bar, change `Owned by Me` to `Public images`. Search for `mongodb-service-broker-lab`. Click Launch.

=== Provisioning Wizard

When launching, accept defaults except where specified.

==== Choose an Instance Type

* Use `t2.large` (8 GB memory).

**E-learning Students**: *Please note that, though this instance type is not free-tier eligible, it is necessary for completing the service broker lab and the PCF Developer course.* **Costs associated with its use are negligible.** *Charges cease as soon as the instance is deprovisioned (the steps for deprovisioning are at the end of the lab).*

==== Configure Instance Details

Auto-assign Public IP  = `Enable`

==== Add Storage

Accept defaults

==== Tag Instance

Create the following: Key = `Name`; Value = `{yourname}-mongodb-service-broker`

==== Create a Security Group

Create a security group with the following rules:

.Rule 1
--
Type = `ssh`
Protocol = `TCP`
Port Range = `22`
Source = `anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
--

.Rule 2
--
Type = `Custom TCP Rule`
Protocol = `TCP`
Port Range = `27017`
Source = `anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
--


==== Review Instance Launch

Select your key-pair and launch the instance.

Once the instance is running, select it in list of EC2 instances. ***Obtain the public IP for use in the lab***.

== Accessing Your Mongo VM Remotely

SSH using your private key, the `ubuntu` user and the public IP address of your VM.

For example:

[source.terminal]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem ubuntu@53.91.185.0
