== Preface

So you can deploy your app, you can scale it.  But what if we wish to automate scaling an application up and down during periods of higher and subsequently lower traffic.  PCF allows us to automate scaling via the marketplace service named the _App Autoscaler_.

In this exercise we'll introduce a load against our application, and watch it automatically scale up to multiple instances, and then automatically scale back down to a specified minimum.  Enjoy.

== Setup

. Ensure the `articulate` application has one application instance running.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 1
----

== Provision and Bind an Autoscaler Service Instance

. Read the documentation about https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-7/appsman-services/autoscaler/autoscale-configuration.html[App Autoscaling^].

. Review what's in the marketplace.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf marketplace
----

. Create a autoscaler service instance.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf create-service app-autoscaler standard autoscaler
----

. Bind the service to `articulate`.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf bind-service articulate autoscaler
----
+
NOTE: You can ignore the "TIP: Use 'cf restage articulate' to ensure your env variable changes take effect" message at this time.

. Restart the application.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf restart articulate
----

== Configuring Autoscaling Service Instance

. View `articulate` in Apps Manager.
+
.. Navigate to the `Services` tab.
.. Click the `Manage` link for the autoscaler (this will open a new tab).
+

. Edit instance limits
+
.. Click 'Edit'
.. Set the minimum number of instances to 2 and the maximum to 5
.. Click 'Save'
+

. Return to Apps Manager and observe the number of instances increase from `1` to `2`.

== Generate Load and Observe the Results

One popular option for generating a load against a web site is by using the Apache
load-testing tool http://jmeter.apache.org/[JMeter^].  Instructions for JMeter are
outlined below.

[NOTE]
====
Another option is to use a PWS marketplace service named _Load Impact_.  One advantage
of using Load Impact is that you don't have to download and install any software to
your laptop in order to conduct a load test:  it's all done via a web interface.
Further, the load test itself is run from the cloud:  the test specification can
specify what geographic location will serve as the origin of the load test.  If
you feel like trying Load Impact instead of JMeter, head on over to the PWS
Marketplace in your Apps Manager, and create an instance of that service, then
follow the instructions for creating a test.

=== Generating a Load with JMeter

. You should already have `apache-jmeter-XXX.zip` in your lab files, where XXX is the
  version number.  (if you prefer you can download the latest
  http://jmeter.apache.org/download_jmeter.cgi[Apache JMeter^] for yourself).
  It will be used to generate load.  Review the JMeter
  http://jmeter.apache.org/usermanual/get-started.html[getting started^] directions.

. Do _ONE_ of the following:
+
[alternatives#hints]
*Linux and Mac*
+
[#tabs-hints-1.hints]
--
.. Add execute permissions to the JMeter script: `chmod +x {jmeter_basedir}/bin/jmeter.sh`
.. Start JMeter by executing `{jmeter_basedir}/bin/jmeter.sh`
--
+
*Windows*
+
[#tabs-hints-2.hints]
--
.. Start JMeter by double clicking the following file in Windows Explorer: `{jmeter_basedir}/bin/jmeter.bat`
--
 
. In your lab files you will find a JMeter configuration file: `load-gen.jmx`.

. Import the `load-gen.jmx` file with the JMeter GUI (`File` +->+ `Open`).

. Expand the content of the JMeter test plan by:
+
.. Selecting the `Load Generator` test plan on the left pane.
.. Going to the menu: `Options` +->+ `Expand All`.

. Under `HTTP Request`, edit the test plan as follows:
+
.. Set the value of the `Service Name or IP` field to your applicationâ€™s fully-qualified hostname (do not include the `http://`).  For example: `jsmith-articulate.cfapps.io`
.. Set the value of the HTTP Request `Path` field to `/services`

. Save the test plan: `File` +->+ `Save`.

. Run the test plan: `Run` +->+ `Start`.

. Use Apps Manager and the `cf` CLI to observe your service scale up and back down based on load.

. Stop the test plan: `Run` +->+ `Stop`.

. Review Autoscale history:

[NOTE]
====
An even better option for monitoring the state of your application, including your application instances and their CPU usage, is to install the cf cli plugin *cf top*.  Head on over to the cloud foundry https://plugins.cloudfoundry.org/[plugins catalog^], locate the plugin named 'top' and install it.  It's definitely worth your time.

== Clean up

. Unbind the `autoscaler` service instance.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf unbind-service articulate autoscaler
----

. Delete the `autoscaler` service instance.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf delete-service autoscaler
----

. Scale `articulate` back to original settings.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf scale articulate -i 1
----

. Restart `articulate`.
+
[source.terminal]
----
cf restart articulate
----
