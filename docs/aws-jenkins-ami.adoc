A Jenkins VM (Ubuntu 14.04) is available to complete the continuous delivery lab.
The VM is hosted on Amazon Web Services.

== Requirements

Network connectivity and access for Jenkins to reach your Pivotal Cloud Foundry
environment (push on your behalf).

== Installed Software

The software listed below has been installed and configured on the VM:

* Jenkins - https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Document=GovernanceDocument-License[License^]
* JDK 1.8 - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/terms/license/index.html[License^]
* Git - https://git-scm.com/about/free-and-open-source[License^]
* GitHub Plugin - https://github.com/jenkinsci/github-plugin/blob/master/LICENSE[License^]
* Cloud Foundry Plugin - https://github.com/jenkinsci/cloudfoundry/blob/master/LICENSE.txt[License^]


== Provisioning

You can use the following `jenkins.tf` terraform script in you lab-files, in
`pivotal-cloud-foundry-developer-workshop/terraform`.

Alternatively, you can provision the VM manually by following these directions:

. User must have access to an AWS account (can run from any account)
. User must have an existing key pair in the account or create one
. The AMI can be found be searching for `jenkins-continuous-delivery-lab` in the EC2
  Dashboard.  Must be in the N. Virginia region.

In the left navbar of the EC2 dashboard, under `Images`,  select `AMIs`. Then, to the
left of the search bar, change `Owned by Me` to `Public images`. Search for
`jenkins-continuous-delivery-lab`. Click Launch.

=== Provisioning Wizard

When launching, accept defaults except where specified.

==== Choose an Instance Type

* Use `t2.medium` (4 GB memory)

**E-learning Students**: *Please note that, though this instance type is not free-tier
eligible, it is necessary for completing the continuous delivery lab and the PCF
Developer course.* **Costs associated with its use are negligible.** *Charges cease
as soon as the instance is deprovisioned (the steps for deprovisioning are at the end
of the lab).*

==== Configure Instance Details

Auto-assign Public IP  = `Enable`

==== Add Storage

Accept defaults

==== Tag Instance

Create the following: Key = `Name`; Value = `{{yourname}}-jenkins`

==== Create a Security Group

Create a security group with the following rules:

.Rule 1
....
Type = `ssh`
Protocol = `TCP`
Port Range = `22`
Source = `anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
....

.Rule 2
....
Type = `HTTPS`
Protocol = `TCP`
Port Range = `443`
Source = `anywhere` (0.0.0.0/0)
....


==== Review Instance Launch

Select your key-pair an launch the instance.

Once the instance is running, select it in list of EC2 instances.

***Obtain the public IP for use in the lab***.

== Accessing Your Jenkins VM Remotely

=== HTTPS

A self signed certificate is used, so browser warnings are expected.

Access Jenkins via the `https://{{jenkins_ip_address}}/`.

==== Credentials:

**Username:** `pivotal`

**Password:** `keepitsimple`

=== SSH

SSH using your private key, the `ubuntu` user and the public IP address of your VM.

For example:

[source.terminal]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/my-key-pair.pem ubuntu@{{jenkins_ip_address}}
