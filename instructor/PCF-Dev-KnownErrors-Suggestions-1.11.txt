         PCF DEVELOPER 1.11.a: SUGGESTIONS, KNOWN ERRORS, WORKAROUNDS
         ------------------------------------------------------------

* INSTALLATION *

The labs consist of predefined applications, so there is nothing to build or
compile (except for the Service Broker lab - and it is minimal there).  This is a
course for developers but does not require much coding.  The audience can thus
be using any language supported by PCF and no particular language knowledge is assumed.
You should make this point clear up-front.

The main example (Actuate) is a Java application, but no Java knowledge is expected.

The lab-instructions originally assumed students would download everything they needed
as they went along, but this is not always possible (especially when teaching onsite
where Internet access is restricted for corporate security reasons).

All the lab resources are provided in a single zip file (along with the slides PDF
and lab-instructions).  However the notes still say "Download ..." in several
places.  You should make clear this is optional.
